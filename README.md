# Project-II


## Overview
The aim of this project is to be able to draw conclusions from a dataset, and to be able to retrieve information from webpages and estructure them so that it's possible to analyse together with the dataset.

## Introduction
The consummer experience and their principles or apetices can vary depending on how and where they decide to consume. With the rise of Amazon, many independent booksellers have struggled and lost the battle against Goliath to simply exist. But others have been able to survive organising themselves and entering the virtual realm.
This study will try to describe the differences in bestselling books between spanish amazon consuers and spanish independent consumers.

## Datasets
I used two datasets from the kaggle webpage, one with the name _Amazon Top 50 Bestselling Books 2009 - 2022_, in the following [direction](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/chriskachmar/amazon-top-50-bestselling-books-2009-2022), and the other with the name _"Top Books in Spain: Ranking & Details. 2020 Market Trends in Fiction & Non-Fiction Books"_, in the following [direction](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/top-books-in-spain-ranking-details), made through scrapping from a page of spanish independent bookshops and their bestsellers of 2023, called [_Todos tus libros_](https://www.todostuslibros.com/mas_vendidos).
Later, another dataset was buildt through web scrapping from this page to get data from 2023.
